To-Do:

2. **IP Address Handling**: Your current setup only handles IPv4 addresses. For IPv6 support, ensure your database columns can store IPv6 addresses and adjust the PHP logic accordingly.

3. **FingerprintJS Integration**: You've mentioned the use of FingerprintJS, but there's no actual integration in the provided code. You'll need to include the FingerprintJS library and adjust the JavaScript code to generate and send the fingerprint to the server.

6. **Old Database Entries Purge**: There's no mechanism to automatically purge old database entries. Consider adding a cron job or a scheduled task to handle this.

7. **Handling Disabled Cookies and Caching**: Ensure your script works even if a user has disabled cookies and caching. This might involve server-side checks and not relying solely on client-side scripts.

8. **Performance**: Ensure that your script doesn't slow down the page load. This might involve optimizing database queries, reducing the number of database calls, and ensuring efficient JavaScript execution.

9. **Compatibility**: Ensure your script is compatible with PHP 8.2 and MySQL 8.4 (MariaDB 10.11). Also, avoid using jQuery or other non-vanilla JavaScript libraries.

10. **Security**: Ensure your script is secure. This includes:
   - Using prepared statements (which you're already doing) to prevent SQL injection.
   - Validating and sanitizing user input.
   - Protecting against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
   - Implementing proper authentication and authorization for the admin dashboard.

11. **Additional Improvements**: Consider adding:
   - Logging mechanisms to track suspicious activities.
   - Notifications or alerts for the website admin when certain thresholds are reached.
   - A mechanism to differentiate between genuine users and bots.
